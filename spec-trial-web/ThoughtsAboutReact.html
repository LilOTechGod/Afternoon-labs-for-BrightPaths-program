    I honestly, and truly want to learn React but what I found most difficult was the use state and props on different data through out your components. Pursing React for me would be like learning a new programming language because of the awesome websites you'll be able to create, from the UX/UI to the style and your pages loading almost instantly because JS is working in the background to fetch data bases on what action was called for without reloading or leaving the page and it then updates what I see on the screen.
